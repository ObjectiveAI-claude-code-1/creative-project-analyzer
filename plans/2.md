## Implementation Approach

Since the function schema supports `vector.completion` tasks with conditional evaluation, each of the 8 dimensions will be implemented as a set of vector.completion sub-tasks that evaluate specific criteria.

For conditional tasks, we'll use a structure that checks for the presence of optional fields:
- Tasks 5-8 should only produce output when their corresponding optional field is provided
- This can be achieved using conditional expressions in the task definitions

The function will produce a vector of 4-8 scores depending on which optional inputs are provided.

---

## Test Inputs

### Test 1: Minimal Input (Text Description Only)
```json
{
  "creative_work": "A large-scale installation consisting of 10,000 suspended paper cranes, each hand-folded from recycled newspapers. The cranes are arranged in a gradient from pure white at the top to deep indigo at the bottom, suspended at varying heights to create a sense of movement when air currents pass through. Visitors can walk beneath the installation, experiencing the subtle rustle and shadow play."
}
```
**Purpose**: Tests the 4 always-evaluated dimensions with rich creative content. No optional fields, so conditional tasks should be skipped.

---

### Test 2: Full Context (All Optional Fields)
```json
{
  "creative_work": "A 3-minute animated short film combining 2D hand-drawn characters with 3D environments. The narrative follows a child's imaginary journey through a grandmother's antique shop, where objects come alive with memories. The animation style shifts between watercolor textures for emotional moments and sharp geometric forms for action sequences.",
  "creator_statement": "I wanted to explore how objects carry emotional memory and how imagination transforms mundane spaces into worlds of wonder. The shifting animation styles represent the fluidity between reality and imagination in childhood perception. My goal was to create something that adults would find nostalgic while children would find magical.",
  "target_audience": "Families with children ages 5-12, particularly those interested in indie animation. Secondary audience is animation enthusiasts and festival programmers who appreciate technical innovation in short-form storytelling.",
  "project_constraints": "Created over 18 months by a team of 3 animators with a budget of $15,000. Limited to open-source software (Blender, Krita). No access to professional voice actors, so used minimal dialogue with emphasis on visual storytelling.",
  "references": "Inspired by Hayao Miyazaki's sense of wonder, particularly 'Spirited Away' and 'My Neighbor Totoro'. Also influenced by Isao Takahata's use of varied animation styles in 'The Tale of Princess Kaguya'. Contemporary influences include the texture work in 'Wolfwalkers' and the emotional intimacy of 'The Red Turtle'."
}
```
**Purpose**: Tests all 8 dimensions. Rich context enables evaluation of intentional coherence, audience fit, constraint navigation, and contextual positioning.

---

### Test 3: Visual Work (Image Input)
```json
{
  "creative_work": "[IMAGE: Abstract digital painting with fractal patterns emerging from organic shapes, deep purples transitioning to electric blues, with subtle geometric overlays suggesting data visualization aesthetics]",
  "creator_statement": "Exploring the boundary between natural growth patterns and computational aesthetics. I wanted to create something that feels simultaneously biological and digital, raising questions about the nature of generative systems.",
  "references": "Drawing on the bio-digital work of Refik Anadol, the fractal explorations of Mandelbrot, and the color theory of Josef Albers."
}
```
**Purpose**: Tests image-based input with partial optional context (creator statement and references, but no target audience or constraints). Should evaluate 6 dimensions.

---

### Test 4: Performance/Time-Based Work (Video Input)
```json
{
  "creative_work": "[VIDEO: 7-minute experimental performance piece featuring a dancer interacting with projected geometric animations that respond to movement. The dancer moves through phases of struggle, acceptance, and transcendence, with the projections shifting from constraining boxes to flowing organic forms]",
  "target_audience": "Contemporary dance and digital art enthusiasts, particularly those attending interdisciplinary arts festivals. The work assumes familiarity with both physical theater traditions and interactive digital art.",
  "project_constraints": "Performed in a small black box theater with limited projection capability. Single performer, real-time motion capture using consumer-grade sensors. 2-week rehearsal period with technology integration."
}
```
**Purpose**: Tests video input with partial optional context (target audience and constraints, but no creator statement or references). Should evaluate 6 dimensions, including Audience Resonance and Constraint Navigation but not Intentional Coherence or Contextual Positioning.

---

### Test 5: Audio/Music Work
```json
{
  "creative_work": "[AUDIO: 12-minute ambient composition blending field recordings from a decaying factory with synthesized drones. The piece builds through three movements: industrial cacophony, gradual decay, and emergent natural sounds as nature reclaims the space. Binaural recording techniques create an immersive spatial experience.]",
  "creator_statement": "This piece is an auditory meditation on entropy and renewal. I recorded the sounds of a factory my grandfather worked in, now abandoned for 30 years. The synthesized elements represent the ghost of industrial activity, while the emerging bird songs and wind sounds represent nature's patient reclamation.",
  "project_constraints": "Field recording conducted over a single weekend due to building demolition schedule. Limited to portable recording equipment and laptop-based processing. Self-released with no budget for mastering."
}
```
**Purpose**: Tests audio input with emotional, personal context. Evaluates how well the system handles sound-based creative work.

---

### Test 6: Conceptual/Minimal Work
```json
{
  "creative_work": "An empty white room with a single sentence painted in small black letters on one wall: 'You came here expecting something.' A small bench faces the text. The installation remains up for 6 months; visitors are given blank notebooks and encouraged to write their responses."
}
```
**Purpose**: Tests evaluation of conceptual art with minimal physical manifestation. Challenges the system to evaluate originality and emotional resonance in work that is deliberately sparse.

---

### Test 7: Highly Technical Work
```json
{
  "creative_work": "A procedurally generated music visualizer that analyzes audio in real-time using FFT decomposition, mapping frequency bands to particle systems with physics simulation. The system runs on a custom-built LED cube (32x32x32 resolution) using distributed microcontrollers. Users can inject their own music via Bluetooth, and the visualization adapts to genre through machine learning classification.",
  "project_constraints": "Built entirely from salvaged electronic components and open-source hardware. Total materials cost under $500. Code written in C++ for performance, with Python ML pipeline for training. Solo project completed over 2 years of weekend work.",
  "references": "Inspired by the large-scale LED work of TeamLab, the audio-reactive installations of Ryoji Ikeda, and the democratized hardware movement exemplified by Arduino and Raspberry Pi communities."
}
```
**Purpose**: Tests evaluation of highly technical creative work where craft and problem-solving are primary. Missing creator statement and target audience.

---

### Test 8: Commercial/Applied Design Work
```json
{
  "creative_work": "Brand identity system for a sustainable coffee roaster, including logo (abstract mountain/coffee bean hybrid), color palette (earth tones with unexpected coral accent), custom typeface, packaging design for three product lines, and environmental graphics for their flagship café. The system emphasizes craft, locality, and environmental responsibility through material choices and visual language.",
  "creator_statement": "We wanted to create a brand that felt grounded and authentic without falling into clichéd 'eco' aesthetics. The coral accent represents optimism and energy within an otherwise restrained palette. Every element should communicate quality and care.",
  "target_audience": "Urban professionals ages 28-45 who view coffee as a ritual rather than mere fuel. They value sustainability but are skeptical of greenwashing. They appreciate design but distrust anything that feels 'designed.' Secondary audience is café staff who will interact with the brand daily.",
  "project_constraints": "6-week timeline from brief to final delivery. Budget allowed for custom typeface but not original illustration. All packaging must be fully recyclable using existing manufacturing processes. Logo must work in single-color applications for stamps and embossing."
}
```
**Purpose**: Tests evaluation of applied/commercial creative work with clear practical constraints and target audience. Tests whether the system can appreciate design that serves commercial goals.

---

### Test 9: Edge Case - Provocative/Challenging Work
```json
{
  "creative_work": "A performance piece where the artist sits silently in a gallery for 8 hours a day, wearing a suit made entirely of rejection letters received over a 20-year career. Visitors can read the letters if they approach closely enough. The artist maintains eye contact with anyone who meets their gaze. At the end of each day, the artist removes and burns one letter.",
  "creator_statement": "This work confronts the hidden labor and emotional toll of creative careers. Every artist's portfolio shows successes; this piece shows what's usually hidden. The burning ritual transforms rejection into release, but slowly—acknowledging that processing failure takes time.",
  "references": "Building on the durational performance tradition of Marina Abramović, the vulnerability of Tracey Emin's confessional work, and the institutional critique of Andrea Fraser. Departing from these influences by centering career labor rather than the body or art market."
}
```
**Purpose**: Tests evaluation of challenging performance art that may be emotionally uncomfortable. Tests ability to assess conceptual depth and intentional coherence in provocative work.

---

### Test 10: Low-Quality/Student Work
```json
{
  "creative_work": "A digital illustration of a fantasy dragon done in a semi-realistic style. The dragon is purple with gold accents, breathing fire, flying above a castle. The anatomy shows some inconsistencies (wings attached at odd angle, rear legs seem too small). The fire effect is handled well with good color gradation, but the castle in the background is less detailed and uses a noticeably different style. Overall composition is centered and static.",
  "target_audience": "General fantasy art fans on social media, particularly those on DeviantArt and ArtStation who appreciate creature design."
}
```
**Purpose**: Tests evaluation of work with clear technical weaknesses alongside strengths. Ensures the system can provide balanced, fair assessment of developing artists.
